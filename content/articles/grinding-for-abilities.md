Abilites in Splatoon are very important in the competitive scene, however it can be hard to obtain the abiltites you want. In this guide I will be sharing the best way to get pure gear in Splatoon 3.

## Picking the Gear
There is only one major factor to picking the gear you want to grind for. Each gear is connected to a brand. This brand determines the probabilty of getting two different abilities. One abiltiy has FIVE TIMES the normal chance, and the other ability has HALF the normal chance. Try to pick a gear based on the ability you want to get and do your best to avoid brands that have a lower chance of getting that ability. For a list of the brands favored abilities check out the [Splatoon Wiki](https://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Brand). (For the quickest method pick a a piece of gear that you haven't played with).

## Finding Your Gear Seed
Believe it or not, the abilties you get in Splatoon are not completely random. They are determined by a gear seed. We can use this seed to figure out what abilties we will get and grind accordingly. There are two methods for finding gear seeds.

### The Standard Method
This method will take the longest, but will work on ANY gear no matter what. Make sure you start with a piece of gear that has completely empty slots. Then you wanna head to [Lean's Gear Seed Recovery](https://leanny.github.io/splat3seedchecker/#/seedrecover). You'll be met with a bunch of options which can be overwelhming, but I will break it down for you. First enter the brand of the gear you want to get the abilities (skip the part that says gear that will be for a seperate method). Now here's the grindy part. You'll have to have to start unlocking slots then you add what ever ability you get into the website. Keep clicking search seed until it brings it down to one seed. This can take only 4 slots or it could take 10 slots. You just will have to get lucky. You can speed up the process by scrubbing your gear every slot, because the first slot takes at least one win in any mode to unlock. Once you get your seed make sure to copy it. We will use it in a second.

### The Quick Method
This method will only work on BRAND NEW GEAR (gear you haven't played with). Head to [this](https://discord.com/invite/dgYZW4bqep) Discord server and then dm the bot in the server "!s3gear". This will take a minute or so to go through. Follow the steps provided by the bot, and you should get a file. Download it and you'll then upload it to this [link](https://leanny.github.io/splat3seedchecker/#/settings). (If you buy more gear you will have to go through the same process again since it doesn't automatically update). Go to the gear database page on the same website and find the gear you want. Click on it, select new gear, and hit save. This method saves a whole lotta time, because you can go straight to the unlocking abilities phase.

## Getting the Abilities
Now that we have the seed, we can find the gear path. Go to the [gear seed checker](https://leanny.github.io/splat3seedchecker/#/). If you used the first method, select the brand, then click search target, and then enter the seed. If you have drinks or some ability chunks (it can really help if you have those) make sure to select those options as well. Finally, enter the search target (the abilities you want to get). You'll get a path. Follow the steps provided to get the abilites you want. For the second method the steps are largely the same. Select the gear you saved from the Discord bot and then continue as normall. (The seed and brand will be automatically entered). Now you can follow the path.
