The online semi-final matches took place on the 28th of May. The two winning teams were Overtime and Land of Tomorrow. Their match should have been decided in an upcoming LAN event but both teams unfortunately couldn't make the date. After this, the final match was changed to an online event.

The final match took place on the 21st of July. It was streamed in English by [Dapple Productions](https://dapple.ink/) and in French by [EBTV](https://esportbros.tv/). Overtime took the win that day and swept through their matches, though many of the games came down to the wire, with Overtime edging out Land of Tomorrow with their speed.
