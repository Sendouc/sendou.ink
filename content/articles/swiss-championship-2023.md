The Swiss Championship is part of the official Nintendo European Championship tournament to crown the best team in Europe. The tournament took place as a LAN tournament at the [Fantasy Basel](https://fantasybasel.ch/de) on the 18th of May 2023. There were no qualifiers for it.

A total of 9 teams traveled across Switzerland to Basel to compete in this event. [BryBry](https://twitter.com/BrybryPokebip), who won the championship himself in the past, TOed the tournament at the location.

The winners are:
1st: Golden Ratio
2nd: Préférence Pêche
3rd: [Bish n' Chips](https://sendou.ink/t/bish-n-chips)

Golden Ratio, our Swiss Champion 2023, won the tournament without dropping a single game. [Trizy](https://sendou.ink/u/tristan), [Phoenix](https://sendou.ink/u/phoenix), [96Magi](https://sendou.ink/u/96magi) and [RevengeZ](https://sendou.ink/u/revengez) showed how experienced they are and proved themselves worthy of the title with a clean sweep of the competition.

Préférence Pêche got second. They had an amazing performance but in the end, it was not enough to beat Golden Ratio on the big mainstage of Fantasy Basel. The team members here were [XploRiver](https://twitter.com/Spl_River), Roylouk, [Depito](https://twitter.com/Depito5) and [Hugeaux](https://twitter.com/Hugeaux_). Whilst they may not have won the title, they did get some other cool prizes!

[Bish n' Chips](https://sendou.ink/t/bish-n-chips) took the bronze. Moments before the grand final, they played their match for third and emerged victorious. [Oni](https://sendou.ink/u/344123679329878016), [Swordi](https://sendou.ink/u/swordi), [Yorumi](https://sendou.ink/u/yorumi) and [Kosmos](https://sendou.ink/u/490576772363059210) were the members of this team that rightfully earned their place. Getting third is nothing to be ashamed of with this level of competition, and they also got some cool prizes to take home.
