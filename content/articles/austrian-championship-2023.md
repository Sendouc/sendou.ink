The Austrian Championship is part of the official Nintendo European Championship tournament to crown the best team in Europe. The tournament took place offline in Vienna on the 5th of August. There were four qualifiers for it. It was a mixture of offline and online tournaments.

1st Qualifier: (27th of May 2023)
The first qualifier happened as part of the [A1 Austrian eSports Festival 2023](https://esportsfestival.at/). The official post from Nintendo was posted 3 days before this event, so the turnout of teams was rather low. Käsleberkässemmel took the chance and qualified for the first spot in the final tournament. The team consists of names you have already heard in the German-speaking competitive scene: [Marky](https://sendou.ink/u/marky), [EST](https://sendou.ink/u/495600073661743124), Dxmi, [Burgundy](https://sendou.ink/u/bgdy323) and KC. These talented members showed their skill whilst giving every English speaker a nightmare trying to pronounce their names.

2nd Qualifier: (25th of June 2023)
The second qualifier happened at the [AREA 52](https://area52.at/) Summer Special on the 25th of June. The winning team was JPCC.

3rd Qualifier: (7th of July 2023)
The third qualifier was the only online tournament in this series; YMCA took the win here.

4th Qualifier: (27th of July 2023)
The last qualifier was offline again at the location of [AREA 52](https://area52.at/). The champion of this tournament is no easier to pronounce than the 1st qualifier: Schwanzflossenwatschen! Consisting of [Sui](https://sendou.ink/u/sui), [G](https://sendou.ink/u/651407142045351966), [Naivesz](https://sendou.ink/u/naives), [Raze](https://sendou.ink/u/330599850049798146) and [tokitonico](https://sendou.ink/u/tokitonico), they were the last group of 5 to qualify for the final tournament.

The final match took place on the 5th of August at the venue of [AREA 52](https://area52.at/) in Vienna. Schwanzflossenwatschen took a clean win to achieve the title of Austrian Champions 2023, without dropping a single game in the final tournament!
