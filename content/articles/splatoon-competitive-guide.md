If you're new to the Splatoon competitive scene, you're in the right place. In this guide I'll be walking you through everything you need to know to get started. I've outlined every section in the table of contents so if you only need one specific piece of information you can always just skip around.

## Discord Communities
Discord communities can provide almost everything you need to get started. You can find teams, play in scrims and tournaments, and get better. But, there are so many communities out there it can be hard to find the ones you need. Luckly there is a server called [Inkopolis Crosswalk](https://discord.gg/R5dFQnKu). Inkopolis Crosswalk contains a lists of servers for all needs. Whether you want to join some tournaments, find a salmon run crew, or discuss some datamines Inkopolis Crosswalk has it all. There are some other important servers that are included in Crosswalk, but are important enough that I felt I should highlight them. Sendou.ink (the very website you're on) is a the hub for Splatoon 3 competitive, but Sendou also has a [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/sendou). Now if you want to be directly in the midst of competitive Splatoon 3 [Leagues Under The Ink](https://discord.gg/3hr4gFWQPA) is the largest online Splatoon league.

## Finding a Team
Finding a team can be difficult at times. You need to know who's looking for a team or if you're even good enough to be apart of a team. The good thing is, there are teams for all kinds of skill levels. In LUTI (Leagues Under The Ink), there are multiple divisons, you have the highest divison: X and you can be as low as 11 but there are places for all kinds of skill levels across leagues. In most Discord servers there usually is a channel called "looking for team" or something along those lines. DM (direct message) a user to determine whether they have a team already, how serious they plan on being, and also how they want to compete (as in what tournaments, online or in person, and how often). You can also look on other sites like Reddit and Twitter to look for more people or you can post your own "looking for team" messages (make sure to provide all the information I previously mentioned to make it easier to find the right people). 

## Scrimming/Practicing
Scrimming and practicing are pretty much the same thing. If you're looking for a team to scrim with, as always, there are channels and Discord servers that you can use to find teams to scrim with. It's best that you find a team close to your skill level that matches with your team's schedule. If you can find a team like that you may have a scrim buddy on your hands. A scrim buddy can be super useful because you'll have team that you can go against consistently and they'll get better as your team gets better. Aside from scrimming it's always best to review your gameplay. Look out for mistakes you constantly make and try to correct yourself. If you don't know what you're doing wrong getting a second opinion can be really useful. You can share replay codes with others as there is usually a channel dedicated in most server to share replay codes.

## Particpating in Tournaments 
Inkopolis Crosswalk has a tournaments channel. They have a ton of servers for all kinds of tournaments varying in intensity (how competitive they are). Each tournament has their own ways of siging up so look for an about channel or help desk. If those don't help you could always ask someone else. Also make sure whatever tournament you're joining supports your timezone. They don't always account for Europe or Asia, so double check. Remember, you might not win on your first go, but what's important is that you bounce back. Playing these tournaments as much as you can can give you some experiance and help you get out there.

## Other Resources
I tried to cover the gist of Splatoon competitive, but there is always more to learn. Check out other servers for any questions you might have. There are also some great content creators that you can follow that'll help you improve.
