Gear abilities are an essential part to Splatoon 3. Abilities can alter weapon stats, player stats, and even some mechanics. In this guide I'll explain abilities are and how you get the ones you want.

## Abilities
Each piece of gear comes with 1 primary ability and at LEAST 1 secondary ability (up to 3 secondary slots total). Somes primary abilities are exclusive to the type of gear you use (like headgear, clothing, and shoes) and (if they are not a gear-type exclusive ability) they have a larger effect. Secondary abilites are not exclusive to gear-type and they have a smaller effect.

A list of primary abilities:
| Headgear          | Clothing         | Shoes           |

Now all of this information may be overwhelming, but there are two simple ways to figure out what abilities to use. Method 1: use random abilities and find out which ones you like playing with more. We all have our own playstyles, so it's best that you figure out what you want to use yourself. Method 2: listening to the pros. On sendou.ink you can other players builds for different weapons. Find the weapon you want to use and look at what abilities the pros use. They know what's meta and what's not so you can trust them.

## How to get abilities 
Abilities can be difficult to obtain due to their grindy nature. However, there is a way to insure you get the abilities you want. Each piece of gear has a seed. This seed determines what abilities you get and what order you get them. "How do I find the seed?" you may ask. There is a website that lets you determine the seed of your gear called [Leanny Gear Seed Recovery](https://leanny.github.io/splat3seedchecker/#/seedrecover) First you need to select the brand of your gear. Then here's the grindy part, you have to roll slots on your gear and input them on the website. This could take a while. To speed up the process you can scrub your gear after every roll so you only have to win one match each roll. This could talk 4 rolls or it could take 9 rolls. Once it narrows it down to one seed take that seed and go [here](https://leanny.github.io/splat3seedchecker/#/). Select search target, then put the brand, and then the seed.
