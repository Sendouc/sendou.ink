Gear abilities are an essential part to Splatoon 3. Abilities can alter weapon stats, player stats, and even some mechanics. In this guide I'll explain abilities are and how you get the ones you want.

## Abilities
Each piece of gear comes with 1 primary ability and at LEAST 1 secondary ability (up to 3 secondary slots total). Somes primary abilities are exclusive to the type of gear you use (like headgear, clothing, and shoes) and (if they are not a gear-type exclusive ability) they have a larger effect. Secondary abilites are not exclusive to gear-type and they have a smaller effect.

A list of primary abilities:
| Headgear          | Clothing         | Shoes           |
