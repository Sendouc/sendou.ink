The German Championship is part of the official Nintendo European Championship tournament to crown the best team in Europe. The final tournament took place offline at Gamescom in Cologne on the 25th of August. There were four online qualifiers for it. The qualifiers were organized by [Dapple Productions](https://dapple.ink/) in cooperation with Nintendo Germany.

1st Qualifier: (9th of July 2023)
[Black Lotus](https://sendou.ink/t/black-lotus) was the first team that qualified for the final at Gamescom. [Noctis](https://sendou.ink/u/yenoctis), [Wasabi](https://sendou.ink/u/794201321376448542), [Zay](https://sendou.ink/u/zay), [Anger](https://sendou.ink/u/anger) and [Barli](https://sendou.ink/u/539007264917422081) absolutely proved themself worthy to play on the big Nintendo stage. The second team that qualified that day was Enperry Scrimshaw with an impressive roster of [TommiEcho](https://sendou.ink/u/142363033832914944), [T_y\_\_n](https://sendou.ink/u/213761245734502400), [Ben](https://sendou.ink/u/282240600479105025), [Heaven](https://sendou.ink/u/726389792237027370) and North. Here we witnessed that the old champion, BackSquids, will not be competing again and that the German crown will most likely not be an easy task to archive.

2nd Qualifier: (15th of July 2023)
The winners of the second qualifiers were Haarige Hinterländler. [Toyoben](https://sendou.ink/u/toyoben) led [Storm](https://sendou.ink/u/splastorm), [Okami](https://sendou.ink/u/okami), [Meiko](https://sendou.ink/u/meiko) and [Shouko](https://sendou.ink/u/shouko) to victory over the second-place team [Centopia](https://sendou.ink/t/centopia). [Kirbay](https://sendou.ink/u/kirbay), [Yaru](https://sendou.ink/u/yaru), [Lufre](https://sendou.ink/u/narcissist), [Endor](https://sendou.ink/u/endor) and [Pat](https://sendou.ink/u/411620250027556897) had an amazing run but in the end, they could not beat this insane team in front of them.

3rd Qualifier: (22nd of July 2023)
The third qualifier saw a clear victor and gave us an insane team for the final tournament. KaiZer, consisting of [Mika](https://sendou.ink/u/412599483096891393), [WMajin](https://sendou.ink/u/majin), [Fly0](https://sendou.ink/u/flyzero), [ZerraZ](https://sendou.ink/u/397097842411569152) and Whis are just people to be afraid of if you are unlucky enough to face them. Though if it will be enough for the German championship will be seen in the final tournament! The second place in this tournament also qualified for the final like the weeks before. Energie Kopfnuss finally qualified after getting third in all of the qualifiers before this one. [Erik](https://sendou.ink/u/164303447456350208), [Akio](https://sendou.ink/u/flexfred), [Kenshin](https://sendou.ink/u/kenshin), [Tamako](https://sendou.ink/u/tamako) and [Mevlingo](https://sendou.ink/u/mevlingo) must have been more than happy about this result.

4th Qualifier: (29th of July 2023)
This tournament was the last opportunity to qualify for the final tournament. Reverse took this win after showing us a growing performance with each prior tournament. [Yame](https://sendou.ink/u/yame), [Smmuiii](https://sendou.ink/u/smmuiii), [Yοshι](https://sendou.ink/u/sniper_yoshi), [7fox](https://sendou.ink/u/754406516244873327) and [★OliverNEW](https://sendou.ink/u/olivernew) likely trained a lot to get this win! Die Randoms took the second place of this tournament and with that, all teams had been decided. [Wiesel](https://sendou.ink/u/wiesel), MyMyX, [Momo](https://sendou.ink/u/264452174552104980), [$ћınınǧ](https://sendou.ink/u/shiningtheguitarrist) and Fursay saw their chance and made the most of the moment.

It was commentated live by known German casters [Wadsm](https://twitter.com/TheWadsm) and [Cyo](https://twitter.com/InklingOnFire).

In the end, KaiZer took the win over Haarige Hinterländler in an insane close 3-2 match, crowning them the German Champion of 2023.
