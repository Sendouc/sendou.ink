## What is SendouQ?

SendouQ is a third-party matchmaking service for Splatoon 3, offering a more competitive alternative to the in-game matchmaking. Matches are conducted in a first-to-4 format, with maps and modes selected by the players. The service is free and open to all players.

## How do I use SendouQ?

Begin by logging in to [sendou.ink](https://sendou.ink) and setting up your profile. Access SendouQ via [https://sendou.ink/q](https://sendou.ink/q). Upon entry, select your placement; if unsure, pick lowerâ€”the system will adjust your placement based on performance. Specify your game mode preference and map selection. Once set, join the queue. For more details, view the [feature showcase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIRNcTFDYzA).

## Why can't I see my rank?

Ranks are assigned after completing 7 sets.

## Why can't I see my rank history?

Rank history becomes available once you've played 7 sets on 3 separate days on server time.

## Both teams misreported the score. What do I do?

A score is accepted if reported identically by both teams. Verify the score before submission to avoid this issue. If you believe the score was fraudulently misreported, please report it on the [sendou.ink Discord server](https://discord.gg/sendou) and report it on the #helpdesk channel. Please be prepared to provide screenshots for proof.

## The opposing team canceled the match after several games were played. What happened?

Matches can only be canceled if both teams agree to it. If the match was cancelled, someone from your team accepted the cancel request thus legitimizing the match cancellation.

## Why do I have more points than my opponent but I'm ranked lower?

Rank updates aren't real-time. Allow a few minutes for the server to update, then check your rank again.

## I won a set but didn't gain any points. Why?

Ranking points are influenced by the relative team skills. High-ranked teams gain fewer points defeating lower-ranked teams, reflecting the expected outcome. To earn more points, compete against similarly or higher-ranked teams.

## I won a set but lost points. Why?

SendouQ employs [openskill.js](https://github.com/philihp/openskill.js) for rank calculations. Though widely utilized and accurate, its behavior may occasionally seem counterintuitive. In rare instances, you might lose points on a win or gain points on a loss, albeit with small changes. You can reduce how often this can happen by competing against similarly ranked teams. For an elementary understanding, refer to the [openskill.py documentation](https://openskill.me/en/stable/manual.html). For deeper insight, the [whitepaper](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/online_ranking/online_journal.pdf) is available, though it requires a strong grasp of Bayesian statistics, equivalent to upper-undergraduate level math.
