## Running locally

### sendou.ink

Prerequisites: [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

There is a sequence of commands you need to run:

1. `nvm use` to switch to the correct Node version. If you don't have the correct Node.js version yet it will prompt you to install it via the `nvm install` command. If you have problems with nvm you can also install the latest LTS version of Node.js from [their website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Install latest version of [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
3. `bun install` to install the dependencies.
4. Make a copy of `.env.example` that's called `.env`. Filling additional values is not necessary unless you want to use real Discord authentication or develop the Lohi bot.
5. `bun migrate up` to set up the database tables.
6. `bun run dev` to run the project in development mode.
7. Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/admin`. There press the seed button to fill the DB with test data. You can also impersonate any user (Sendou#0043 = admin).

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.

## Tests

### `db-test.sqlite3`

Empty DB with the latest migration run. When creating new migrations they should also be applied+committed to this file (add it in `.env` and then run the migration command as normal).

### Translations

[Translation Progress](https://github.com/Sendouc/sendou.ink/issues/1104)

sendou.ink can be translated into any language. All the translations can be found in the [locales folder](./locales). Here is how you can contribute:

1. Copy a `.json` file from `/en` folder.
2. Translate lines one by one. For example `"country": "Country",` could become `"country": "Maa",`. Keep the "key" on the left side of : unchanged.
3. Finally, send the translated .json to Sendou or make a pull request if you know how.

Things to note:

- `weapons.json` and `gear.json` are auto-generated. Don't touch these.
- If some language doesn't have a folder it can be added.
- Some translated `.json` files can also have some lines in English as new lines get added to the site. Those can then be translated.
- Some lines have a dynamic part like this one: `"articleBy": "by {{author}}"` in this case `{{author}}` should appear in the translated version unchanged. So in other words don't translate the part inside `{{}}`.
- There is one more special syntax to keep in mind. When you translate this line `"project": "Sendou.ink is a project by <2>Sendou</2> with help from contributors:",` the `<2></2>` should appear in the translated version. The text inside these tags can change.
- To update a translation file copy the existing file, do any modifications needed and send the updated one.

Any questions please ask Sendou!

### Articles

1. Take an existing article as a base: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sendouc/sendou.ink/rewrite/content/articles/in-the-zone-26-winners.md
2. Copy and paste the contents to a text file
3. First, edit the info section at the top:

- "title" = title of the page
- "date" = date when this article was written (format YYYY-MM-DD)
- "author" = your name as you want it shown on the website

4. Write the actual article below the second `---`
5. You can use Markdown for more advanced formatting (read https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax for more info)
6. Name the file as you want the URL to be. For example `in-the-zone-26-winners.md` becomes `https://sendou.ink/a/in-the-zone-26-winners`
7. Send the file to Sendou (or open a pull request if you know how)
8. Optional: also send an image as .png if you want to show a link preview. The preferred dimensions are 1200 × 630.

## SQL Logging

By default SQL is logged in truncated format. You can adjust this by changing the `SQL_LOG` env var. Possible values are "trunc", "full" and "none".

Note it only logs queries made via Kysely.

## API

If you want to use the API then please leave an issue explaining your use case. By default, I want to allow open use of the data on the site. It's just not recommended to use the same APIs the web pages use as they are not stable at all and can change at any time without warning.

## Project structure

├── migrations/ -- Database migrations

└── scripts/ -- Stand-alone scripts to be run outside of the app
```

NOTE: `public/static-assets` should only have files that don't change as it is cached for 1 month.

### Feature folders

Feature folders contain all the code needed to make that feature happen. Some common folders include:

- routes (same principle as Remix file system routing)
- queries
- components
- core (all core logic, separated from any React details)

Some common files:

- styles.css
- feature-hooks.ts
- feature-utils.ts
- feature-constants.ts
- feature-schemas.server.ts

## Commands

### Update friend code

```bash
bun scripts/update-fc.ts 79237403620945920 1234-1234-1234
```

### Add new badge to the database

```bash
bun scripts/add-badge.ts fire_green "Octofin Eliteboard"
```

### Rename display name of a badge

```bash
bun scripts/rename-badge.ts 10 "New 4v4 Sundaes"
```

### Add many badge owners

```bash
bun scripts/add-badge-winners.ts 10 "750705955909664791,79237403620945920"
```

### Converting gifs (badges) to thumbnail (.png)

```bash
sips -s format png ./sundae.gif --out .
```

### Convert many .png files to .avif

While in the folder with the images:

```bash
for i in *.png; do npx @squoosh/cli --avif '{"cqLevel":33,"cqAlphaLevel":-1,"denoiseLevel":0,"tileColsLog2":0,"tileRowsLog2":0,"speed":6,"subsample":1,"chromaDeltaQ":false,"sharpness":0,"tune":0}' $i; done
```

Note: it only works with Node 16.

## How to...

### Download the production database from Render.com

Note: This is only useful if you have access to a production running on Render.com

1. Access the "Shell" tab
2. `cd /var/data`
3. `cp db.sqlite3 db-copy.sqlite3`
4. `wormhole send db-copy.sqlite3`
5. On the receiving computer use the command shown.

### Doing monthly update

1. Fill /scripts/dicts with new data from leanny repository:
   - weapon = contents of `weapon` folder
   - langs = contents of `language` folder
   - Couple of others at the root: `GearInfoClothes.json`, `GearInfoHead.json`, `GearInfoShoes.json`, `spl__DamageRateInfoConfig.pp__CombinationDataTableData.json`, `SplPlayer.game__GameParameterTable.json`, `WeaponInfoMain.json`, `WeaponInfoSpecial.json` and `WeaponInfoSub.json`
2. Update `AVAILABLE_SR_GEAR` with new SR gear & new gear bought with scales
3. Update all `CURRENT_SEASON` constants
4. Update `CURRENT_PATCH` constants
5. Update `PATCHES` constant with the late patch + remove the oldest
6. Update the stage list in `stage-ids.ts` and `create-misc-json.ts`. Add images from Lean's repository and avify them.
7. `bun scripts/create-misc-json.ts`
8. `bun scripts/create-gear-json.ts`
9. `bun scripts/create-analyzer-json.ts`
   8a. Double check that no hard-coded special damages changed
10. `bun scripts/create-object-dmg-json.ts`
11. Fill new weapon IDs by category to `weapon-ids.ts` (easy to take from the diff of English weapons.json)
12. Get gear IDs for each slot from /output folder and update `gear-ids.ts`.
13. Replace `object-dmg.json` with the `object-dmg.json` in /output folder
14. Replace `weapon-params.ts` with the `params.json` in /output folder
15. Delete all images inside `main-weapons`, `main-weapons-outlined`, `main-weapons-outlined-2` and `gear` folders.
16. Replace with images from Lean's repository.
17. Run the `bun scripts/replace-img-names.ts` command
18. Run the `bun scripts/replace-weapon-names.ts` command
19. Run the .avif generating command in each image folder.
20. Update manually any languages that use English `gear.json` and `weapons.json` files

### Fix errors from the CI Pipeline

If you change any files and the CI pipeline errors out on certain formatting/linting steps (Biome) run this command in the repo's root directory:

```sh
bun cf
```

Before committing, if for some reason you see an abnormally high amount of files changed, simply run `git add --renormalize .` and it will fix the error.

- Background info: this is caused by the line endings on your local repo not matching those with the remote repos, which should remove the vast majority of unstaged files that appears to have no changes at all.
- Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/configuring-git-to-handle-line-endings
