# Contributing

## How to contribute

### Creating issues

You are free to create issues about bugs, feature requests or just questions about the project. Try to include all relevant information e.g. with bugs what browser you have tested and how to reproduce.

### Making pull request

1. Identify an issue to work on

- Issues I have identified as potentially good for external contributors [are marked with the help wanted tag.](https://github.com/Sendouc/sendou.ink/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)
- Alternatively if there is something else you want to work on (maybe a bug you found or a new feature) I recommend creating a new issue about it before making a pull request. This way I can give any pointers or identify any problems before you use time to make the pull request.

2. Leave a comment to the issue that you will be working on it.

3. Make pull request

- Tell me how I can test it and include unit / E2E tests if possible.
