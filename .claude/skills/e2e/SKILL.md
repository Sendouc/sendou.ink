# E2E Test Runner

## Architecture overview

- Tests live in `e2e/*.spec.ts`, config in `playwright.config.ts`
- Page objects live in `e2e/pages/<feature>/` — every spec uses them; conventions in `docs/dev/e2e-page-objects.md`, gotchas in `docs/dev/e2e-page-objects-migration.md`
- Global setup (`e2e/global-setup.ts`) builds the app (skipped when no build input changed since the last e2e build — tracked via `.e2e-build-marker`), creates/migrates per-worker databases (via `scripts/ensure-test-db.ts`: pending migrations are applied, drifted databases are rebuilt), and starts one server per worker
- Port calculation: `E2E_BASE_PORT = PORT (from .env) + 500`. Worker N uses port base+N, except ports on the WHATWG fetch bad port list (e.g. 6679) are skipped — see `e2eWorkerPort` in `e2e/helpers/playwright.ts`
- Worker count: `E2E_WORKERS` env, defaulting to `min(8, max(4, cores - 2))`
- Worker databases: `db-test-e2e-<N>.sqlite3` in the project root; every test starts from a wiped database holding only the admin (Sendou) and N-ZAP users, and builds its own data with the `factories` fixture
- MinIO (S3-compatible storage) is started via Docker Compose if not already running

## Pre-flight checks (run before every test execution)

Before running tests, check for these common issues:

1. **Port conflicts** — Check if anything is already listening on the e2e ports (base port + worker index):
   ```
   lsof -i :4501-4508 2>/dev/null
   ```
   If ports are occupied by leftover e2e servers, kill them. If occupied by something else, warn the user.

2. **Docker running** — MinIO requires Docker. Check with `docker info` if there are storage-related failures.

Stale worker databases (`db-test-e2e-*.sqlite3`) are handled automatically: global setup applies pending migrations and rebuilds databases whose migration history has drifted.

## Running tests

### Run all tests
```bash
pnpm run test:e2e
```

### Run a specific test file
```bash
pnpm exec playwright test e2e/<name>.spec.ts
```
Batch multiple files into one invocation — every invocation pays global setup.

### Flaky detection (repeats each test 10 times, stops on first failure)
```bash
pnpm run test:e2e:flaky-detect
```

### Force a rebuild of the app
```bash
E2E_FORCE_BUILD=true pnpm run test:e2e
```
Global setup reuses the previous build when nothing under `app/`, `public/`, the lockfile, or the vite/react-router configs changed. Use this override if you suspect a stale build (e.g. after changing env-dependent build behavior).

## Debugging failures

Follow this funnel when tests fail:

### Step 1: Read the error output
- Look for the actual assertion or timeout that failed
- Check if it's an infrastructure error (server didn't start, migration failed) vs. a test logic error

### Step 2: Check infrastructure issues
Common infrastructure errors and fixes:
- **"table already exists"** → Should not happen anymore (global setup rebuilds drifted worker DBs); if it does, `rm -f db-test-e2e-*.sqlite3` and investigate `scripts/ensure-test-db.ts`
- **"Server on port X did not start within timeout"** → Port conflict or app build error. Check ports with `lsof -i :<port>` and check for build errors
- **"MinIO failed to start"** → Docker not running or compose issue. Check `docker info`
- **"Test ended with database writes the server never saw"** → A factory call was not followed by a helper that talks to the server; add a `navigate`/`impersonate` after the writes

### Step 3: Reduce to single debug worker
If the error is unclear, re-run with debug output and a single worker to see server logs:
```bash
E2E_DEBUG=true E2E_WORKERS=1 pnpm exec playwright test e2e/<failing-test>.spec.ts
```
This shows stdout/stderr from the test server, which is hidden by default.

### Step 4: Examine trace artifacts
Playwright is configured with `trace: { mode: "retain-on-failure", snapshots: false }` — failure traces carry screenshots, network and action logs but no DOM snapshots (recording those cost ~17% of total suite time). After a failure, check `test-results/<test-folder>/error-context.md` for the page's accessibility snapshot at failure time, or view the trace:
```bash
pnpm exec playwright show-trace test-results/<test-folder>/trace.zip
```
When a failure needs full DOM snapshots to understand, re-run just that test with `--trace retain-on-failure` (the CLI flag records complete traces).

### Re-render races
Live events run on an in-process event bus per worker server (SSE, see `app/features/events`), so cross-worker crosstalk cannot cause flakes. Google Fonts are also blocked at the context level so font swaps never reflow the page mid-test. Re-renders from the test's own action revalidations can still swallow a React Aria press (press start registers, press end never fires — no POST); `waitForPOSTResponse` retries for this, so route flows through it rather than adding sleeps.

Other known sources, each handled once in the helpers or page objects:
- YouTube is stubbed at the context level (a fake `iframe_api`, everything else aborted): the real player loads from the internet at its own pace and, arriving mid-test, closed an open select on the VoD form
- dnd-kit stops every click in the document for 50ms after a drop; drag helpers end with `waitForDropToSettle` so the next click lands
- A tab or link clicked before hydration (after a raw `page.reload()`, say) loads the target as a new document and the click after it is lost; reload through the page object's `reload()` which waits for hydration
- Popovers close on navigation in a passive effect, so for a frame the old panel and the new page both show the same names; scope locators to `main` where a name can appear in both
- React Router drops a fetcher's redirect when a navigation (a revalidation included) started after the submission; broadcast revalidations are jittered up to 1.5s after a live event, so one could land mid-submission and the action silently did nothing. `holdRevalidationsDuring` (used by `useActionSubmit` and `SendouForm`) defers them until the submission settles

## Test pattern reference

Every test builds its own data with factories and drives the UI through page objects:

```typescript
import { NZAP_TEST_ID } from "~/db/seed/constants";
import { expect, impersonate, test } from "./helpers/playwright";
import { BuildsPage } from "./pages/builds/builds-page";

test.describe("Feature", () => {
	test("does something", async ({ page, factories }) => {
		await factories.BuildFactory.create({ ownerId: NZAP_TEST_ID });

		await impersonate(page, NZAP_TEST_ID);
		const builds = new BuildsPage(page);
		await builds.goto();
		// ... interact via page object methods, assert in the spec ...
	});
});
```

Key rules:
- The database starts each test holding only the admin and N-ZAP; the `factories` worker fixture (see `e2e/helpers/factories.ts` for the registry) creates everything else
- Locators live in page objects under `e2e/pages/` — specs contain no raw `getByTestId`/`getByRole` calls; see `docs/dev/e2e-page-objects.md`
- Use `navigate()` instead of `page.goto()` — it waits for hydration (page objects' `goto()` methods wrap it)
- Use `submit()` instead of clicking submit buttons directly — it waits for the POST response
- Use `impersonate(page, userId?)` to authenticate. Default is admin (ADMIN_ID); prefer N-ZAP (`NZAP_TEST_ID`) when the flow doesn't need admin rights
- Avoid `page.waitForTimeout` — use assertions or `waitFor` patterns instead (the one exception is `waitForDropToSettle`, dnd-kit's post-drop window has nothing observable to wait on)
- Import `test` from `./helpers/playwright` (not from `@playwright/test`) — it includes worker port fixtures and the database reset
- Factory writes must be followed by a helper that talks to the server (`navigate`, `impersonate`, `submit`) or the test fails with "writes the server never saw"
