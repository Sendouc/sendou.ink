      <h2 className="text-lg">Disconnections</h2>
      <div>
        Each team is allowed one replay per set due to a team member
        disconnecting. Replay is only possible if ALL of the following are true:
        <ol>
          <li>
            More than half was left in the clock (the clock was 2:30 or higher
            at the time of the DC)
          </li>
          <li>
            The team without DC&apos;s objective counter had not reached 30 at
            the time of the disconnect
          </li>
          <li>Team with the disconnection stopped playing without delay</li>
          <li>Disconnection was unintentional</li>
        </ol>
        For the replay same weapons and gear must be used by both teams. The
        team who fails to do so loses the map. If players disconnect from both
        teams a replay can be played without using either team&apos;s one replay
        for the set (or even if there were no replays left to use from either
        team). Host disconnection can be replayed with the same conditions as
        above.
        <br />
        <br /> After the DC replay has been used by the team, further DC&apos;s
        should be played out.
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-lg mt-4">Unallowed weapons</h2>
      <div>
        If someone picks an unallowed weapon game can be canceled within 1
        minute by any player. For the replay everyone has to use the same
        weapons and gear except the player with unallowed weapon who should
        switch to the allowed variant of the weapon. For example had a player
        picked Foil Squeezer they need to play regular Squeezer in the replay.
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-lg mt-4">Subs</h2>
      <div>
        There are no subs. If a player is unavailable to play from either team
        then the set must be played with 3 players or forfeited.
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-lg mt-4">Canceling match</h2>
      <div>
        Match can be canceled if both group owners agree. If the groups
        don&apos;t agree then the match should be played out.
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-lg mt-4">Room hosting</h2>
      <div>
        By default the player who says the fastest in the match chat that they
        will host should do it. If a host can&apos;t be decided then Alpha
        chooses a player to host from their group.
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-lg mt-4">Alting</h2>
      <div>You can only play with one account.</div>

      <h2 className="text-lg mt-4">Player eligibility</h2>
      <div>
        Players banned by{" "}
        <a href="https://twitter.com/splatsafety">
          Splatoon Competitive Community Safety
        </a>{" "}
        are not allowed to participate. Playing with banned players is not
        allowed.
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-lg mt-4">Time limits</h2>
      <div>
        After a team has all their members in the lobby and has shared the
        password with the other team then that team has <b>15 minutes</b> to
        join the lobby. Failing to do so, the match can be started with the
        members currently in the room. If a player has problems connecting to
        the room it is advised to try switching the host.
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-lg mt-4">Spectators</h2>
      <div>There can be spectators if both teams agree to it.</div>

      <h2 className="text-lg mt-4">Intentional losing</h2>
      <div>
        Players are not allowed to intentionally lose a match. This includes
        (but is not limited to) tanking your own rank on purpose or boosting
        another player&apos;s/team&apos;s ranking.
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-lg mt-4">Unsportsmanlike conduct</h2>
      <div>
        It&apos;s not allowed to spawncamp the enemy without pushing the
        objective provided it can&apos;t be considered a viable strategy taking
        in account the game situation.
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-lg mt-4">Discriminatory language</h2>
      <div>
        Any kind of discriminatory language such as using slurs is strictly not
        allowed. This rule applies everywhere in SendouQ including (but not
        limited to) text chats, voice chats & in-game names.
      </div>

      <h2 className="text-lg mt-4">Repercussions</h2>
      <div>
        Players found breaking the rules can lose access to SendouQ and other
        sendou.ink features such as tournaments and the Plus Server.
