 * ink hues (clustered against the first read that saw both); a status read
 * carries no ink and inherits the orientation of the nearest counter read in
 * time (same frames). Broadcast replay wipes re-run an earlier moment with the
 * HUD intact, so both series are anchored by projected clock zero (`t + time`)
 * against one shared dominant projection and reads off it are dropped;
 * timerless reads follow their preceding anchored neighbor. A displayed count
 * never increases, so each side keeps only its longest non-increasing score
 * run (blips voided, not charted). Then into `teams` order: scoreboard-closed
 * is winner-first (POV seat when read; else in SZ the side whose count went
 * furthest down), minimap-grouped anchors on the minimap's own-vs-enemy ink
 * colors, no signal keeps the first read's arrangement. Slots keep their
 * on-screen left-to-right order through a side swap (whether the game mirrors
 * slot order across sides is unattested).
 *
 * Minimap reads contribute status samples too (card cross-out and camo
 * states), interleaved on the same replay-wipe anchor. Their sides are
 * own/enemy — camera-stable — so they skip cluster orientation and map to
 * `teams` through the match's minimap ink anchor.
 *
 * Within a side the strip's slot order is the lobby seating while a results
 * scoreboard re-sorts rows per game (attested in the sendou-triton VoD), so on
 * a scoreboard-closed match each side's slots are reordered into row order via
 * slot-row-assignment.ts: weapon votes from StripWeapons evidence plus the
 * minimap's card columns (mirror the strip seating; attested for the enemy
 * column, own column assumed symmetric). The POV diamond follows neither
 * order, so its flags map by card name and stay as drawn when too few names
 * resolve. A minimap-grouped match's samples stay as drawn by construction.
